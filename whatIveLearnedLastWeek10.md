## JavaScript Object

Object is an array without indexes. 

For example:

    let person = {
        firstName: 'LeBron',
        lastName: 'James',
        age: 37,
        eyeColor: 'Brown'
    }

firstName, lastName, age, eyeColor - properties of the variable `person`. 'LeBron', 'James', 37, 'Brown' - values of those properties. 

Accessing properties:

person.firstName or person['firstName']
